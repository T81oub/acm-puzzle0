				<h1>#Internet Puzzle</h1>
				<p>the beginning of the ACM internet puzzle. There will be six puzzles in this game, and each puzzle's output serves as a link to the next puzzle. The riddle that will direct you to the ACM Registration Form is #Puzzle0. While puzzle 1 serves as the starting point of our competition in which you can win a price, you will receive puzzle 1 or your first game clue after you complete your interview with ACM. The sooner you complete the interview, the higher your chances of winning. In general, the puzzle questions are reasonable, however,Â until puzzle 5, they will become increasingly challenging.</p>
